                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Start with focusing on your pre- and post- workout nutrition one day at a time.  </p> 

               <h1>Pre-Workout Meal</h1> 
                
              <p>  1-3 hours before working out
                Provides you with physical and mental energy from all the macro and micronutrients from your food.  
                If you train very early in the morning, (5:30am classes), you may not have time for a pre-workout meal.  Make sure that your meal the night before was nutrient dense and well balanced (carbs, proteins, and fats).  
                Protein
                
                Eat plenty of lean protein before your workout.  You literally break down your muscles during exercise and weight training.  Protein keeps amino acids stocked while promoting protein synthesis.  
                </p>
                <br>
               <h2>Carbs</h2> 
                
               <p> Fill up on slow digesting carbs.  Exercise depletes your glycogen and glucose levels, so you need carbs to replenish them!
                </p>
               <br>
               <h2>Fat</h2> 
                
            <p>  Keep your fat intake low in your pre-workout meal.  Fat slows down digestion.  You don?t want to feel uncomfortable in the middle of a hard WOD!
                </p>  <br>
               <h2>Immediately Pre-Workout OR During Workout</h2> 
                
                <p>30 minutes to immediately before a workout
                My 5:30 classes, this option is ideal for you!
                Only refuel mid workout if it?s a very long workout.  </p>
               <br>
                <h2>Protein</h2>
                
                <p>Whey protein shake.  It is a very fast digesting protein.</p>
                <br>
               <h2>Carbs</h2> 
                
               <p>Stick with really fast digesting carbs such as gatorade, coconut water, Vitargo.  If you?re doing multiple sessions, eat foods such as white rice, fresh or dried fruit between.
                </p> <br>
              <h2>  Fat</h2>
                
               <p> Avoid fats completely as they slow down your digestion.</p>
                <br>
               <h2> Post-Workout</h2>
                
              <p>Have this meal within an hour of your workout.  This meal helps with your recovery tremendously.
                </p> <br> 
               <h2>Protein</h2> 
                
               <p> To promote muscle maintenance and growth.</p>
                <br>
              <h2> Carbs</h2> 
                
               <p> To replenish glycogen stores and help with recovery.</p>
                <br>
              <h2>  Fat</h2>
                
               <p>Slows down digestion, so keep this very low.</p>

<h2><strong>IN SUMMARY:</strong></h2>
<P>In summary, avoid high fat foods around your workout time.  

    Have a meal with lean protein, slow digesting carbs, and low fat 1-2 hours before your workout.
    
    Bring a shake with carbs + protein to your workout (Whey Protein + Gatorade or coconut water). Drink half of that shake within 30 minutes of your workout.  Drink the other half of the shake directly post workout. 
    
    Eat your post workout meal within an hour of your workout with lean protein and a mix of slow and fast digesting carbs.  </P>
