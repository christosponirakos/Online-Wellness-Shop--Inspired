                    <p>Willingly devoting yourself to being punched takes guts. Even the elite out there had some degree
                        of fear when they were new to the battleground. Tensed muscles, hyper mind, and clenched jaw are
                        some of the obvious side effects for beginners when first starting out boxing.

                        Some helpful beginner boxing techniques can surely go a long way in the early stages. The below
                        mentioned ten boxing tips for beginners are easy to follow and can improve one?s game in no
                        time. Let?s shoot for them right away.</p>


                    <h2>1. Minimize Mistakes ? Come Well Prepared </h2>
                    You can start off your training by getting not only the best but also the right right boxing gear
                    and equipment such as:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p> A Standing Punching Bag</p>
                    <p> Boxing Gloves</p>
                    <p>MMA Heavy Bag Gloves</p>
                    <p> Speed Bag, platform, and swivel</p>
                    <p> Reflex Bag</p>

                    <h2>2. Target the body </h2>

                    <p> The idea is simple, ?Destroy the body to destroy the head.? Going for the body is just one of
                        the boxing tips and tricks that simply goes unmentioned as everyone knows about it but never
                        engages in practicing this technique.</p>
                    <h2>3. Power and precision </h2>
                    <p>If you want to deliver a dreaded punch that can put your opponent to sleep, you should know the
                        best places to punch in addition to knowing how to deliver a knockout punch. Of course, anything
                        above the neck is a good focus area to deliver a knockout blow in a boxing match. But, merely
                        swinging the arms won?t do the trick over here. To deliver a power-packed punch, you should be
                        able to transfer proper speed, weight, and power to the arm at the right time.</p>

                    <h2>4. Drink Lots of Water </h2>
                    <p>Whether your starting boxing for fitness or for professional sport, it goes without saying, a
                        boxer, especially a beginner will invite a lot of sweat while training. By not replacing fluids
                        quickly, a person can risk his health and performance. The inevitable process of sweating can
                        make way for dehydration. When you don?t intake enough water then dehydration can kick in and
                        this is when you get your ass kicked. To avoid quick fatigue and dehydration, supply yourself
                        with sufficient water before, during, and after the training. Proper water intake will not only
                        regulate one?s body temperature, but it will also lubricate the joints and help you to avoid
                        injuries. Not to forget the fact that right amount of water intake will also ensure proper
                        transportation of nutrients in the body for vital energy supply. So, take all possible measures
                        from your end to stay properly hydrated at all times.</p>
                    <h2>5. Watch your steps</h2>
                    <p>Just because boxing only uses the hands to strike doesn?t mean that footwork can go out the
                        window. Good footwork is one of those beginner boxing tips that often gets overlooked but is
                        crucial for offensive and defensive reasons.

                        You should always be on the balls of your feet, not putting too much weight on your front foot.
                        Otherwise, it takes too long for you to move out of the way of a punch or to move towards your
                        opponent to strike.

                        Whether you?re hitting pads, hitting the bag, or sparring, you should focus on staying light on
                        your feet.

                        When it comes to footwork, angles are important too. You don?t just go straight forward or
                        backward when you fight. If you do, you?ll end up going straight down to the mat.

                        Work on using angles to back up or advance. Instead of stepping back to evade a punch, try
                        sliding your back foot so your body turns about 45 degrees. You won?t get hit, and you?ll be in
                        a perfect position to counter.

                        You can practice this on the bag too. Throw a combo, then slide your back foot so you?re facing
                        the bag at a different angle. Immediately throw another combo, and you?re on your way to being
                        unstoppable.

                    </p>
                    <h2>6. Control your Breathing</h2>
                    <p>Improper breathing can cause you to gas out fast.

                        When you?re working the bag, take a breath before every combination. As you throw a punch,
                        breathe out. After your combo is done, step back for a second and breathe in again.

                        Keeping up with this pattern will increase your punching power and prevent you from getting
                        tired easily.

                        While sparring, breathing right is even more important.

                        When an opponent is coming at you, it?s easy to overreact and breathe erratically. But you have
                        to remain in control of your breathing while you spar. Otherwise, you?ll become overwhelmed, and
                        that?s when you make mistakes.

                        As you attack your sparring partner, stick to the same breathing patterns you would use doing
                        bag work. This boxer training tip can make you a more competitive sparring partner.</p>
                    <h2>7. Listen to your trainer </h2>
                    <p>You will be your very best if you have good trainers by your side. Goes without saying, a good
                        boxing gym will be the breeding ground for a host of good trainers who will kick out the best
                        boxer in you. Not to forget the fact that boxing is a risky affair. So, it?s in your best
                        interest to learn the proper form and technique to constantly get better at the sport. </p>
                    <h2>8. Practice, Practice, and Practice </h2>
                    <p>As they say, ?The more you will sweat while training, the less you will bleed on the fight
                        night.? Of course, nothing is baffling about this information, but the idea is to remind you
                        guys that there is no short route to boxing success. Frankly speaking, there should be no
                        opposing viewpoint on this matter. In fact, even if you were to do things at crawling speed, the
                        results would still be better than doing nothing. So, don?t miss out on your boxing training.
                        Not to mention make sure you are training correctly and getting in the best punching bag
                        workouts that you can. You will be rewarded for all the punishments you endure in the boxing
                        gym. And, good boxers might also get a fair share of podium positions down the road. Simply put,
                        your keen interest and commitment towards boxing training can hardly go wrong.

                    </p>
                    <h2>9. Don?t Train till Failure </h2>
                    <p>As mentioned above, practice is an evil devil. You will feel like Peter Parker before he morphs
                        into a Spiderman if you enter a ring on a fight night without good practice. However, don?t
                        overtrain yourself. In other words, don?t train till failure. This isn?t to say that you
                        shouldn?t give your best shot every day. Get tired, and push yourself to do a little bit more
                        every day instead of training till failure. If you train till failure on any given day of the
                        week, you will probably quit boxing soon. Remember, slow and consistent efforts is the key over
                        here. Simply put, don?t try to get to the finish line too soon. Such an undertaking will make
                        the training far harder than usual. You will be losing a lot more energy by trying too hard. As
                        a result, you will achieve fatigue faster than usual. Ultimately, you will make way for bad
                        training habits, which will curb your ability as a fighter in the long run.</p>

                        training. In fact, you have to enjoy every minute of your training. If you do so, boxing
                        training will never get bumped to the bottom of your ?to-do? list. Agreed, training can
                        sometimes be dull and boring. But, you should learn how to reverse the pattern by making
